# Appium_Swipe_Element

## Pip can install packages from Git
I have hosted a Python package on GitHub (python_world), which you can install with the following command (make sure you trust me before running this command and installing my code on your computer).

pip install git+https://github.com/YauheniPo/Appium_Swipe_Element.git#egg=Appium_Swipe_Element

Pip provides options to install from head, from a branch, from a tag or from a commit. I usually tag each release and install from these tags. See the pip install documentation for full details.
