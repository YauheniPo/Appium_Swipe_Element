# Appium_Swipe_Element

## Pip can install packages from Git
I have hosted a Python package on GitHub (appium_swipe_element), which you can install with the following command (make sure you trust me before running this command and installing my code on your computer).

`pip install git+https://github.com/YauheniPo/appium_swipe_element.git#egg=appium_swipe_element`

Pip provides options to install from head, from a branch, from a tag or from a commit. I usually tag each release and install from these tags. See the pip install documentation for full details.
